Factory reset the filesystem

If you pyboard¡¯s filesystem gets corrupted (for example, you forgot to ejectunmount it), or you have some code in boot.py or main.py which you can¡¯t escape from, then you can reset the filesystem.

Resetting the filesystem deletes all files on the internal pyboard storage (not the SD card), and restores the files boot.py, main.py, README.txt and pybcdc.inf back to their original state.

To do a factory reset of the filesystem you follow a similar procedure as you did to enter safe mode, but release USR on green+orange
1.Connect the pyboard to USB so it powers up.
2.Hold down the USR switch.
3.While still holding down USR, press and release the RST switch.
4.The LEDs will then cycle green to orange to green+orange and back again.
5.Keep holding down USR until both the green and orange LEDs are lit, and then let go of the USR switch.
6.The green and orange LEDs should flash quickly 4 times.
7.The red LED will turn on (so red, green and orange are now on).
8.The pyboard is now resetting the filesystem (this takes a few seconds).
9.The LEDs all turn off.
10.You now have a reset filesystem, and are in safe mode.
11.Press and release the RST switch to boot normally.
